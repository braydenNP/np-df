"""
1. Sequentially executes all scripts (browser simulation, email phishing, log manipulation, malware, and network traffic).

2. Adds delays between script executions to mimic real-world attack timelines.

3. Records which scripts ran successfully and any errors encountered.

Relation to the Attack Scenario:
    - Reflects how the attacker (Michael Tan) systematically executed multiple stages of the attack.
    - Provides investigators with timestamps to reconstruct the sequence of events.
    - Leaves behind logs that could reveal the attackâ€™s orchestration.
